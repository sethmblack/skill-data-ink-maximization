# Data-Ink Maximization

Systematically remove non-data elements from graphics to maximize information density. Based on Edward Tufte's data-ink ratio principle.

---

## When to Use

- Chart or graphic feels cluttered
- Too many visual elements competing for attention
- Need to simplify without losing information
- Preparing graphics for publication or presentation
- Dashboard has too much "chrome"

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "My chart is cluttered"
- "How do I simplify this?"
- "There's too much going on"
- "Clean up this graphic"
- "Reduce visual noise"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| graphic | Yes | The visualization to optimize |
| purpose | No | What the graphic needs to communicate |
| constraints | No | Format, size, or context limitations |

---

## Core Principle

> "Data-ink is the non-erasable core of a graphic, the non-redundant ink arranged in response to variation in the numbers represented."
> — Edward Tufte

**The Formula:**
```
Data-Ink Ratio = (Ink used to display data) / (Total ink used in graphic)
```

**The Goal:** Maximize within reason. Every visual element must earn its place by encoding information.

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify All Elements

List every visual element in the graphic:
- Lines (axes, gridlines, borders, data lines)
- Shapes (bars, points, areas)
- Text (labels, legends, titles, annotations)
- Colors (backgrounds, fills, borders)
- Effects (shadows, 3D, gradients)

### Step 2: Classify Each Element

For each element, ask: **Does this encode data?**

| Classification | Definition | Action |
|----------------|------------|--------|
| **Data-ink** | Directly represents a data value | Keep |
| **Redundant data-ink** | Repeats information already shown | Remove |
| **Non-data-ink** | Decoration or structure only | Evaluate |

### Step 3: Apply the Erasure Test

For each non-data element, ask: **If I remove this, do I lose information?**

- If no → Remove it
- If yes → Keep it (it's actually data-ink)
- If maybe → Try removing it and see

### Step 4: Reduce Redundancy

Common redundancies:
- Legend + direct labels (choose one—direct labels preferred)
- Axis title + clear axis labels (often title is redundant)
- Gridlines + axis ticks (usually need only one)
- Border + background color (border often unnecessary)

### Step 5: Lighten Structure

Elements you must keep can often be lightened:
- Heavy gridlines → Light gray or dotted
- Bold axis lines → Thin gray
- Prominent borders → Remove or make subtle
- Dark backgrounds → White or light

### Step 6: Apply the Shrink Test

Shrink the graphic significantly. What survives?
- If it remains readable → Good data-ink ratio
- If it becomes illegible → Too much non-data-ink

## The Erasure Checklist

Remove unless specifically needed:

| Element | Default Action | Keep If |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| 3D effects | Remove | Never |
| Shadows | Remove | Never |
| Gradients | Remove | Encoding a data dimension |
| Background colors | Remove | Essential for grouping |
| Gridlines | Remove | Precise reading needed |
| Axis lines | Lighten | Data near axis |
| Borders | Remove | Grouping multiple charts |
| Legends | Replace | Direct labels impossible |
| Data point borders | Remove | Overlapping points |

---

## Before and After Examples

### Bar Chart
**Before:** Heavy borders, 3D bars, dark gridlines, separate legend, background gradient
**After:** Simple bars, direct value labels, no gridlines, white background

### Line Chart
**Before:** Thick axis lines, heavy gridlines, legend box, data point markers on every point
**After:** Light gray baseline, no gridlines, direct line labels, markers only at key points

### Dashboard
**Before:** Each widget in a box, navigation chrome, decorative icons, colored backgrounds
**After:** White background, widgets separated by space alone, minimal navigation, no icons

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**User:** "I have a bar chart showing sales by region. It has gridlines, a border, 3D bars, a legend, and axis titles. How do I clean it up?"

**Data-Ink Maximization response:**

Let's audit each element:

**Remove completely:**
- 3D effect on bars (pure decoration, distorts perception)
- Border around chart (adds nothing)
- Legend (replace with direct labels)

**Lighten or reduce:**
- Gridlines → Remove entirely or make very light gray, dashed
- Axis titles → If axes are labeled "Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4" and "Revenue ($M)", titles may be redundant

**Keep:**
- Bars (data-ink)
- Axis labels (necessary for reading)
- One axis line (baseline reference)

**Your optimized chart:**
- Simple 2D bars
- Direct labels on or above each bar showing the value
- Light gray horizontal baseline only
- White background
- Region names as x-axis labels
- No legend, no border, no gridlines

Apply the shrink test: if you reduce this to thumbnail size, the bars and their relative heights should still be visible. That's good data-ink ratio.

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **chartjunk-detection** - Identify problems before fixing
- **small-multiples-design** - Apply same principles across repeated elements
- **high-resolution-thinking** - Add data after removing chrome

---

## Constraints

- Don't remove elements that aid accessibility
- Some gridlines help when precise reading is needed
- Consider your audience's expectations
- The goal is maximum clarity, not minimum elements
